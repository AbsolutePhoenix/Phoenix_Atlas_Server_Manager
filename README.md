"Phoenix Atlas Server Manager" is an open-source atlas manager built for ease of use for first-time server managers but with enough power to make the enthusiast happy to use it.

You can run a server grid of any size, globally configure the GameUserSetting.ini and Game.ini files, or you can manage them individually. I am doing my best to make sure that every single setting possible will be configured.

The Launcher runs on java as it is my native programming language. It will not use bat files and all bat files created by atlas will be left alone. Everything is internal to the program itself. So no need to worry about it messing with settings before you try it if you link it to an existing server setup.
<br />
## Quick start
It's easy and free to get started using this server manager. All you have to do is download the PhoenixAtlasServerLauncher.jar from the releases page, Make sure you have <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">AdoptOpenJDK 11 Hotspot</a> installed, Then just run the program.
<br />

## Features
- **Global Configuration**: Configure all the settings for every server on a global scale.
- **Individual Configuration**: Change all the settings for every server on a per-server basis overriding all configurations set.
- **Player Tracking**: Short on resources, but you want a full server grid. No problem. Just enable player tracking and select a home server (or the last server you where on) turn on tracking and log in. The manager will find you and keep the surrounding servers loaded. The manager will also remember where you where last and keep that grid loaded as well as reload it when restart the manager if you want it to.
- **Grid Based Loading**: The manager has a user interface that is set up to show the map of your server, so you can easily see what server you are loading up without having to guess what grid is what.
- **Always On**: When using the manager you are free to close the program at any point, and it will continue to run in the background. That way you can keep playing and not have to worry about finding out that it stopped tracking you.
- **Server Discovery**: When you start the manager. if you have a server running it will test to see if it is on of the managers. If it is then it will re-associate the running server to the program and give you control of it without having to reboot the server.
- **Configurable Port Range** You can configure all the ports to your liking for the servers, evey 1, 2, 3, or, 4 ports. If you find that a port is not working correctly then you can change the port for that single server to get it working correctly.
- **Discord Webhook**: You can send updates to your discord server webhook to let people know when servers are shut down and when they are started.
- **Ready To Go in 3, 2, 1**: This software is designed to get you on your feet as soon as possible. Upon loading the program it will download steamCMD if needed and install Atlas, it will then download the Server Grid Editor and walk you through setting up your first server. Following the instructions will have you up and running within minutes.
- **Complete Control**: Start and stop all game servers and the redis server on demand from within the application itself, enable or disable player tracking for all users or individual users, change settings for every server on a global scale or on a per-server basis, How you use the manager and what features are active are up to you. It is 100% modular.

## Philosophy

Running servers is a hard task if you don't know what you're doing. I am here to help if you have any issues with this program. I want people to have fun with Atlas but a 1x1 or 2x2 grid isn't fun for a lot of people. And the toxicity on the official server is a bit much to handle. This software is designed for ease of use in the attempt to help everyone enjoy Atlas the way they want to.

## Contributing

Until the software has had its first beta release I will not be accepting code contributions. If you want to help with the development of this program and are excited with what it will have to offer then you can join our <a herf="https://discord.gg/Gh4fnxyqCT">discord</a> to keep up to date with what is going on.

I may not be accepting code contributions at the moment but there is a suggestions section on the discord if there is a feature you would be interested in seeing on the manager that may not have been mentioned on this page. So feel free to submit suggestions, and I will take them into consideration.
